# Product Context

## Problem Statement
The uctanuca project addresses the growing need for secure, privacy-focused web applications in a world where data breaches and unauthorized access are increasingly common. Current web applications often lack proper end-to-end encryption, leaving sensitive user data vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access.

## User Problems
- Sensitive user data is not properly encrypted in transit and at rest
- Session management is often insecure, leading to session hijacking risks
- API communications lack proper authentication and encryption
- Users have no way to verify that their data is truly secure

## Solution Approach
uctanuca provides a comprehensive security solution by:
1. Implementing end-to-end encryption for all sensitive data
2. Using secure session management with proper expiration and validation
3. Encrypting all API communications using industry-standard protocols
4. Providing transparent security features that users can verify

## User Experience Goals
- Users should feel confident that their data is secure
- The application should be intuitive and easy to use
- Security features should be transparent but not intrusive
- Users should be able to verify the security of their data

## Value Proposition
A secure web application that protects user data through end-to-end encryption, secure session management, and protected API communications, giving users peace of mind while maintaining a seamless user experience.
